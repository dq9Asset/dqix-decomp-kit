"""BEHAVIOUR tests for the gate. Reading a script proves nothing; this runs it.

    python pipetest.py [n]      n = how many committed functions to sample (default 6)

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every bug that reached a wave was invisible to a line-by-line review:

  * `wgate` never checked the symbol its object exports. There was no wrong line -- the check was
    absent, and you cannot read code that is not there.
  * `translate.py` names its output `Trans_<addr>`, which is correct in isolation and only wrong as
    a contract with symbols.txt, i.e. in a second file.
  * `ov_recover.sanitize` stripped `0x`-looking runs from identifiers, exactly as its comment said
    it would. The comment was wrong. Reading confirmed the code matched its intent, not that the
    intent was right.

The common factor is that reading verifies a file against itself. So this tests the pipeline the
only way that can fail honestly: feed it inputs whose correct verdict is known.

TWO DIRECTIONS, AND THE SECOND IS THE POINT. Known-good sources must gate MATCH -- that catches a
gate that rejects real work. Deliberately broken ones must gate with the SPECIFIC failure they
earn -- that catches a gate incapable of failing, which is how a silent hole survives for months.
A mutation that still passes is reported as a HOLE, because that is what it is.
