# Contributing

Two repositories take contributions:

| what | where |
|---|---|
| matched functions | [ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp](https://github.com/ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp), branch `decomp-matching` |
| recipes and script fixes only | [ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp-kit](https://github.com/ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp-kit) |

## Avoid duplicate work

`claim.py` claims are local to one machine. An address is reserved when it is:

- listed in an OPEN issue in the kit repository, or
- changed by an OPEN pull request on ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp.

An address listed only in a CLOSED issue that has no pull request, and that is not landed in
`decomp-matching`, is free: its owner stopped or failed. Take it.

Keep ONE open issue for everything you are actively working on, never one per function:

1. Skip every reserved address, then open a single issue listing each address you are taking, one
   per line (`main 0205faf4`, `ov017 021bb000-021bc000`).
2. Edit that issue as you add or drop addresses.
3. The moment you open the pull request for those addresses, close the issue with a comment naming
   it (`PR: ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp#27`). Do not wait for the merge; the open pull request now holds
   the reservation. If you stop without a pull request, close the issue saying so.
4. Open a new issue for the next batch.

## Matched functions

1. Fork `ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp` and set it up as in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md): your fork as `origin`,
   ZevyaDev as `zevya`, branch `decomp-matching`.
2. Start from the current branch: `git pull --rebase zevya decomp-matching` on a clean tree.
3. Match and land as in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md). `finish_wave.sh` commits and pushes to your
   fork's `decomp-matching`.
4. Pull both again, right before the pull request, every time (AGENTS.md rule 21):

       python kit_update.py                                  # in the kit
       git pull --rebase zevya decomp-matching               # in the decomp; rebase, never merge
       python tools/configure.py usa && ninja check
       python prready.py decomp                              # in the kit; must print READY

   Push the rebased branch to your fork (`git push --force-with-lease origin decomp-matching`).
5. Open a pull request from your fork's `decomp-matching` against `ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp`
   `decomp-matching`. Send the next batch on a new branch and pull request; never add commits to
   one already open.

A pull request is accepted when:

- every commit leaves `ninja check` green, and `ninja sha1` OK when you have the BIOS dump
- each function is byte-exact and wired into `symbols.txt` / `delinks.txt` (`integrate.py` does this
  through the landing scripts)
- definitions export the names `symbols.txt` binds, and each carries its `// USA:` tag
- there is no hand assembly outside `asm_allow.txt`, no codegen `#pragma`, and nothing added to
  `tools/cc_overrides.txt` or `tools/cc_flag_overrides.txt`
- the source reads like code a developer wrote: typed structs and members, no comments beyond the
  `// USA:` tag unless a line needs one
- it changes nothing outside the functions it lands, apart from header or config changes those
  functions need; never `.github/`, `tools/` or another file a merge resolved to your older copy
- a symbol renamed in one region's `symbols.txt` is renamed in every region that has it
- `python prready.py decomp` prints `READY` against the current `decomp-matching`

A near miss is not a pull request to either repository. Record it in `$SP` with `blocker.py` and the
function's handoff.

## Recipes and script fixes

The kit has been tested and refined over months of matching; do not change it unless you are certain
a change is needed. It takes two kinds of pull request:

- a recipe: a `worker_src/core.md` rule that closed a function now landed on `decomp-matching`
- a script: a `colorsweep.py` rule, a repair, or a fix to a kit script or skill, with the
  `regress.py` case that fails without it

Dead ends, residue notes, trial logs, docs and wording, refactors, comments and hardening against a
fault that never happened are closed without review. Where a recipe or a fix belongs and what proof
it needs: [IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md](IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md).

1. Commit on your kit checkout; `kit_update.py` keeps it on top of every update while the pull
   request is open.
2. Push to your fork of the kit and open the pull request against `ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp-kit` `main`
   (`gh pr create -R ZevyaDev/dqix-decomp-kit`). One recipe or one fix per pull request.

Before opening it, in this order, every time (AGENTS.md rule 21):

    python kit_update.py           # your commits are rebased onto the published kit
    git -C "$(python kitpaths.py repo)" pull --rebase zevya decomp-matching
    python selfcheck.py
    python regress.py              # add --slow after touching colorsweep.py, wdiff.py or wgate.py
    python pipetest.py             # after touching wgate.py, classify.py or integrate.py
    python prready.py kit          # must print READY

`prready.py kit` refuses any `deadends.md` change and a `core.md` rule citing an address that is not
landed: land the match first, then send the rule.

- A new script gets a line in `INVENTORY.md`; `selfcheck.py` fails on an uninventoried script.
- A fix for a fault that happened gets a `regress.py` case that fails without the fix.
- A new `colorsweep.py` rule gets a `regress.py` case and an instance in `pad/ruleprobe.cpp`.
- A lever goes into `worker_src/core.md` as a rule citing the address it was found on, stated in a
  few lines with no history. Run `python build_worker_docs.py` and confirm the text appears in the
  built `worker_*.md`.
- Fix the shared code path; never fork a script per module.
- Read paths through `kitpaths.py`, the compiler and flags through `buildcfg.py`, source directories
  through `srcdir.py`. No machine-specific paths.
- Write files with an editor, not a shell heredoc.
- Edit skills in `.claude/skills/` and agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`. `.agents/skills/` is
  generated by `kit_init.py`; a skill that uses no Claude Code-only tool belongs in
  `PORTABLE_SKILLS` there.
