"""Compact DECODED diff for the iteration loop: only the diverging instructions, side by side.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Cost of matching a large function is roughly (context size) x (iteration count), and
for the large tier both terms are bad: a 2KB function is ~500 instructions, and a worker that dumps
that disassembly once carries ~30k tokens in context for every one of the next 20-40 gate cycles. That
single decision dominates the bill -- measured 08-11, worker context averaged 226k tokens per message
and 83.6% of it was tool output.

wgate says WHICH bytes differ. wdiag prints the raw words. Neither tells you what changed, so the
worker re-disassembles to find out -- and that is the expensive habit. This prints exactly the diverging
instructions, decoded, target vs yours, with one instruction of context either side. A typical
mid-iteration diff comes out at 5-15 lines instead of a 500-line dump.

Usage: python wdiff.py <OV|main> <addr> <file.cpp> [section=.text]
