"""Hill-climb a COLOURABLE near-miss to a match by mechanical, meaning-preserving rewrites.

Every rule here was derived from a function that actually matched:

  R1 operand swap      strcpy/strcmp word test: `t & nw` vs `nw & t` moves the AND destination.
  R2 compound flip     `t &= nw` and `nw &= t` compute the same value in DIFFERENT registers;
                       mwccarm puts the result in the register of the operand that is NOT the
                       assignment target. Flipping the pair is how strcpy and strcmp closed.
  R3 post-inc migrate  strcat: `q = p++; *q = c;` colours r3/ip the opposite way from
                       `q = p; *p++ = c;`.
  R4 decl reorder      recipe #9: callee-saved registers are handed out in reverse definition
                       order, so swapping two independent declarations swaps r4/r5.
  R5 stmt swap         two adjacent independent statements decide which value is live first.

Scoring is wdiff's byte count, so a rewrite that makes things worse is simply dropped. Nothing
here changes program meaning, so a MATCH is a real match and a miss costs only a compile.

    """`T* p = &g;` -> `T* p = &g; p++;` with every `p->` use rewritten to `(p - 1)->`.

    This is the only known C formulation that defeats copy propagation on a global's address
    WITHOUT the pragma. mwcc cannot fold `&g` into the use while the pointer carries a pending
    increment, so the address is materialised early and stays live across several instructions --
    exactly the ROM shape that `#pragma opt_propagation off` was being used to buy. A later pass
    cancels the `++` against the `- 1`, so the emitted arithmetic is unchanged and the only
    difference is where the address is formed.

    Verified on ZoneFeatures WarpScript_Opcode_6b (0x0201d044) and WarpScript_Opcode_7c
    (0x0201e018): both matched byte-exact at the -O2 default after this rewrite, having previously
    matched only under a file-wide `opt_propagation off`.

    Two forms. A: a pointer local already initialised to `&global`. B: a global whose members are
    read directly (`g.field`), where the file also declares `extern T g;` -- bind it to a local
    first, then apply A. Emits the `p--` / `(p + 1)` mirror as well, since which direction the
    compiler keeps is not predictable from the source.

    Meaning-preserving only while `p` is never reassigned after its declaration, so a pointer that
    is stepped or re-pointed later is skipped.
