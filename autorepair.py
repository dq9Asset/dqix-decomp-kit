"""Repair the mechanical faults that park correct work, statically.

Every fault handled here has cost the project batches of finished matches, and
each one used to be found by hand, one function at a time. None of them need a
compile to detect, so the wave applies them to every candidate before judging it.

  1. CALLEE NAMES. A worker declares `SomeName_02171d90(...)` but the committed
     symbol for 0x02171d90 is `func_ov000_02171d90` or a mangled `_Z...` name.
     The link then fails -- or worse, resolves elsewhere. Every such identifier
     carries the address, so it can be reconciled against symbols.txt. Names are
     declared extern "C" so a committed mangled name is not mangled a second time.
  2. .init SECTION. A function whose address lies in .init emits no .text; without
     `#pragma define_section initcode` the file looks empty and is rejected as
     size 0.
  3. KEEP-NAME. When the ROM symbol at this address is a mangled C++ name, the
     keep-raw rewrite would rename it to func_<addr> and break the match. Mark the
     file so the integrator leaves the symbol alone.

Usable as a library (`repair(path, module, addr) -> list[str]`) or on the command
line for one file. Returns the list of repairs applied; makes no other change.
